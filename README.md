# Linear_Regression_with_Ridge_Lasso_Regularization
Using a linear regression model with regularization to experiment with performance improvements.

A great way to model the relationship between a target variable and many features is to simply use a linear regression model! 
However, its not always as simple as throwing together a regression model and expecting great results. Regularization techniques such as
Ridge and Lasso can help improve these models by reducing our residual sum of squares values all which creating a balance between
proper data fitting and reducing overfitting as much as possible.

Check out this small project that put these facts to the test!
